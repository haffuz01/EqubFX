# EqubFX
A kotlin multiplatform project targetting desktop. This is a school project created to allow users to digitalize their 'Equb'
## What is Equb
Equb (Amharic: ·ä•·âÅ·â•) is an association of people in Ethiopian culture with the aim of mobilizing resources and distributing them on a rotating basis via a form of rotating savings and credit association.

Equb is a co-operative social institution, which helps for funeral insurance where community members elect their leaders, contribute resources either in kind or in cash and support the mourning member.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equb)

Participants all contribute a certain ammount of money per a selected ammount of time. For example 5 people might set the pay time to 2 weeks and the pay ammount to 1500 ETB (Ehtiopian Birr). Thus a total of 7500 ETB (5 x 1500) will be saved every two weeks. The next step is distribution, which is also based on a pre-set time, on which a winner of random selection will take the total savings. This is circulated untill all of them have gotten their turn.

Equb is aimed at boosting the participants business by converting their small but recurring investments into a large but one-time payout which they can use for whatever needs they see fit.

## How EqubFX works
EqubFX has pretty match mirrored the experience of the traditional Equb where by initially members list, pay ammount and time is set. Then it automatically picks a winner every round.
## Clonning and running the project
Steps
1. I would highly recommend using [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/) IDE for this project as it is recommended by the team behind Kotlin Multiplatform i.e. jetbrains
2. ``git clone https://github.com/haffuz01/EqubFX`` in to your desired directory
3. Open said directory in fleet
4. Run ``gradle build`` command with Windows as your target
5. I have not tested and modified the project to make it compatible with Android, Linux and MacOS, but I believe that should be achievable with minimal effort
